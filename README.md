# Facebook with less sh*t

A web extention to remove "Sponsored" and "Popular Across Facebook" posts from the Facebook feed.

Available for Firefox [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-with-less-shit/). 
The chrome version was removed from Chrome Web store because of "Facebook" in the name of the extension :( Instead, you can install the extension for Chrome following the instructions given below.
